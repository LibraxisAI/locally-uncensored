/**
 * Cost policy for SILENT model calls (plan 2.6.6 A7 + R5).
 *
 * A silent call is any inference request that does NOT produce the visible
 * assistant reply: memory extraction, the memory write-decision resolution,
 * and anything a future hidden agent adds. opencode's hidden agents
 * (compaction, title, summary) are the warning example — silent model calls
 * are silent money, and on lu-cloud they are billed exactly like a chat turn.
 *
 * Two rules, defined ONCE here so every caller inherits them by construction
 * instead of each call site re-deciding:
 *
 *  1. GATE — on lu-cloud a silent call needs `settings.memoryCloudOptIn`.
 *     Since David's decision of 12.09.2026 that setting ships ON, so a fresh
 *     profile does extract on a cloud conversation; a profile that already
 *     carries the old `false` keeps it, and `autoExtractEnabled` in the memory
 *     settings switches the whole thing off in one click.
 *     Local backends (Ollama, built-in engine, LM Studio) and BYOK keys are
 *     not gated: those calls cost the user nothing we bill for, and BYOK
 *     already has its own switch (memory settings `autoExtractInAllModes`).
 *
 *  2. MODEL — when a silent call does run on lu-cloud it runs on the cheapest
 *     suitable catalogue model, never the active one. The active model may be
 *     a flagship at ~20x the price of the entry model, and a hidden JSON
 *     extraction has no use for it. Locally the active model stays: a second
 *     local model would mean a second VRAM load, which is the expensive
 *     option there.
 *
 * This module is PURE — no stores, no providers, no network. Callers pass the
 * resolved provider id and the model list in.
 */

/**
 * lu-cloud text models ranked cheapest-first, restricted to plain instruct
 * models (no reasoner burns hidden output tokens, no vision surcharge).
 *
 * Derived from the server catalogue (`lib/chat/tier-models.ts`, wholesale
 * $/1M in + out, refreshed 2026-08-09). The first two are on EVERY plan; the
 * rest are the Pro-catalogue fallbacks for the (impossible today, possible
 * tomorrow) case that the hosted shortlist changes under us.
 *
 * NOT a pin: this list is a PREFERENCE, intersected with the models the
 * server actually serves this account right now. Nothing here is required to
 * exist — an id that vanishes from the catalogue is skipped, and if none of
 * them survive, `pickSilentCallModel` falls back to the live size heuristic
 * and finally to the active model. Prices drift daily (see the price-drift
 * guard on the server side), so treat the ORDER as the durable part.
