/**
 * R5-4, R5-5, R5-6: ContentPolicySettings.tsx had drifted from the Web
 * wording in three spots: the "strict" and "off" hints (R5-5, R5-6) and the
 * footnote about what the setting covers (R5-4). One wording is better than
 * two for the two hints that mean the same thing on both sides; the footnote
 * differs on purpose, since Desktop also renders locally and Web does not.
 *
 * This reads the SOURCE of both files rather than importing Web's component
 * (which is a Next.js file the desktop bundle cannot import), matching the
 * fixliste's "string comparison" test shape.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT check this file against PUBLIC_FILTER_WORDS: that
 * guard belongs to the public marketing site on the payment domain
 * (locallyuncensored.com), not to this signed-in-only account setting. The
 * word "filter" stays allowed here.
 *
 * B5 (review-w2ui.md, 18.09.2026): this used to read Web's source through a
 * fixed six-`..` `__dirname` path, which only resolves from
 * `lu-301-wt/<name>/`. Outside that (the main checkout, Windows, CI) the
 * `readFileSync` at module scope threw and took the whole file down. Same
 * fix as `katalog-paritaet-web.test.ts`: LU_WEB_REPO from the environment,
 * then a couple of `process.cwd()`-relative candidates, and a clean skip
 * with a message when none exist, instead of a false green or a hard crash.
 *
 * Run: LU_WEB_REPO=/path/to/web npx vitest run \
 *   src/components/settings/__tests__/content-policy-wording-parity.test.ts
