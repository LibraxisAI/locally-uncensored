/**
 * Bug D, symptom 3. Discord ticket, aldrich_ironhart, 2026-09-08, Windows 11,
 * LU 2.6.8, provider Ollama, DESKTOP app, Code tab:
 *
 *   "Error: Not an allowed workspace folder (only a folder you chose in LU's
 *    folder picker can be a workspace, pick it again to allow it): D:\code"
 *
 * for a folder he had picked. Three things in the Code tab's folder button made
 * that a closed loop, and none of them was measured.
 *
 *  1. `system::pick_folder` recorded the folder with `let _ = …`, so a folder
 *     the allowlist refuses came back as `Ok(Some(path))` with the reason
 *     thrown away. The panel put it in the header as the working directory, and
 *     every file op under it answered with the sentence above.
 *  2. The panel fell back to `window.prompt('Enter folder path:')` whenever the
 *     bridge call threw. A folder joins the allowlist through the NATIVE dialog
 *     and nowhere else, so a typed path was a workspace that could never work
 *     in the packaged app, and the way out of the error was the same prompt.
 *     (In the dev server's browser there is no allowlist at all, so the prompt
 *     is the intended mechanism there and stays.)
 *  3. `check_workspace_root` asked the allowlist BEFORE the structural gate, so
 *     folders no pick can ever allow ($HOME, `C:\Users`, anything under
 *     `AppData`) were also told to "pick it again", which is the one action
 *     that cannot help.
 *
 * Source-level assertions, because `vitest.config.ts` runs environment 'node'
 * and there is no renderer. The MESSAGE is checked for real, it is a pure
 * function. Same split as
 * src/components/layout/__tests__/der-abgelehnte-ordner-wird-nicht-verschluckt.test.ts,
 * which pins the same repair on the Remote-dispatch picker.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/components/chat/__tests__/the-picked-folder-is-not-swallowed.test.ts
